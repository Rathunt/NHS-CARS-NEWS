# NHS-CARS-NEWS
I was involved in a regression model to predict patient health 

Background:  There are no established risk equations specifically for emergency medical patients who are cared for on general medical wards. However, following emergency admission, such patients usually have blood tests and (in the United Kingdom) vital signs monitoring using a physiologically based National Early Warning Score (NEWS) on admission. These data may be used to derive a risk of death on admission, which may be helpful to clinical teams.

Objective: To develop a computer aided risk score (CARS) based on combining the first recorded NEWS and blood test results and compare its performance with separate NEWS and blood test results models.
